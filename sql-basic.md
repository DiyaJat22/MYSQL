# What is SQL?

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for dealing with **Relational Databases**.

SQL is used to:
- Insert data
- Search data
- Update data
- Delete database records

---

## How to Use SQL

The following SQL statement selects all the records in the `Customers` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

---

## Keep in Mind That...

- SQL keywords are **not case-sensitive**: `select` is the same as `SELECT`.
- In this tutorial, we will use **upper-case** for all SQL keywords.

---

## Semicolon After SQL Statements?

- Some database systems **require a semicolon (`;`)** at the end of each SQL statement.
- Semicolons are the **standard way to separate** SQL statements when executing **multiple statements** in the same call to the server.
- We will use semicolons at the end of each SQL statement.
